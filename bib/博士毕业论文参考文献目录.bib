  abstract = {A new method of lower-limb exoskeleton control aimed at improving the agility of leg-swing motion is presented. In the absence of control, an exoskeleton's mechanism usually hinders agility by adding mechanical impedance to the legs. The uncompensated inertia of the exoskeleton will reduce the natural frequency of leg swing, probably leading to lower step frequency during walking as well as increased metabolic energy consumption. The proposed controller emulates inertia compensation by adding a feedback loop consisting of low-pass filtered angular acceleration multiplied by a negative gain. This gain simulates negative inertia in the low-frequency range. The resulting controller combines two assistive effects: increasing the natural frequency of the lower limbs and performing net work per swing cycle. The controller was tested on a statically mounted exoskeleton that assists knee flexion and extension. Subjects performed movement sequences, first unassisted and then using the exoskeleton, in the context of a computer-based task resembling a race. In the exoskeleton's baseline state, the frequency of leg swing and the mean angular velocity were consistently reduced. The addition of inertia compensation enabled subjects to recover their normal frequency and increase their selected angular velocity. The work performed by the exoskeleton was evidenced by catch trials in the protocol.},

  abstract = {Many assistive robotic devices have been developed to augment or assist human locomotion. Despite advancements in design and control algorithms, this task remains challenging. Human walking strategies are unique and complex, and assistance strategies based on the dynamics of unassisted locomotion typically offer only modest reductions to the metabolic cost of walking. Recently, human-in-the-loop (HIL) methodologies have been used to identify subject-specific assistive strategies, which offer significant improvements to energy savings. However, current implementations suffer from long measurement times, necessitating the use of low-dimensional control parameterizations, and possibly requiring multiday collection protocols to avoid subject fatigue. We present a HIL methodology, which optimizes the assistive torques provided by a powered hip exoskeleton. Using musculoskeletal modeling, we are able to evaluate simulated metabolic rate online. We applied our methodology to identify assistive torque profiles for seven subjects walking on a treadmill, and found greater reductions to metabolic cost when compared to generic or off-the-shelf controllers. In a secondary investigation, we directly compare simulated and measured metabolic rate for three subjects experiencing a range of assistance levels. The time investment required to identify assistance strategies via our protocol is significantly lower when compared to existing protocols relying on calorimetry. In the future, frameworks such as these could be used to enable shorter HIL protocols or exploit more complex control parameterizations for greater energy savings.},

Exoskeletal robotic assistive devices can provide a user with continuous assistance but impose movement restrictions. There are currently devices that allow unrestricted movement but provide assistance only intermittently at specific points of the gait cycle. Our design, a cable-driven active leg exoskeleton (C-ALEX), allows the user both unrestricted movement and continuous force assistance throughout the gait cycle to assist the user in new walking patterns. In this study, we assessed the ability of C-ALEX to induce a change in the walking patterns of ten post-stroke participants using a single-session training protocol. The ability of C-ALEX to accurately provide forces and torques in the desired directions was also evaluated to compare its design performance to traditional rigid-link designs. Participants were able to reach 91\% {$\pm$} 12\% of their target step length and 89\% {$\pm$} 13 \% of their target step height. The achieved step parameters differed significantly from participant baselines (p {$<$} 0.05). To quantify the performance, the forces in each cable's out of the plane movements were evaluated relative to the in-plane desired cable tension magnitudes. This corresponded to an error of under 2Nm in the desired controlled joint torques. This error magnitude is low compared to the system command torques and typical adult biological torques during walking (2-4\%).},

In the last few years, many robotic-based rehabilitation devices, like orthosis and exoskeletons, have been designed and developed by researchers to provide locomotion assistance to support gait behavior and to perform daily activities for elderly people. However, there is still a need for improvement in the design, actuation and control of these devices for making them cost-effective in the worldwide market. In this work, a systematic review is presented on available lower limb orthosis and exoskeleton devices, to date. The devices are broadly reviewed according to joint types, actuation modes and control strategies. Furthermore, tabular comparisons have also been presented with the types and applications of these devices. Finally, the needful improvements for realizing the efficacy of lower limb rehabilitation devices are discussed along with the development stage. This review will help the designers and researchers to develop an efficient robotic device for the rehabilitation of the lower limb.},

The WRT speed was lower in the resist condition than in the control condition which reinforces hypotheses from previous simulations, descriptive and experimental studies. There was no increase in WRT speed in the assist condition which is in contrast to another study where the plantarflexor push off was assisted indirectly by a horizontal traction at waist level. The lack of effect from the assist condition in the present study is possibly due to the narrowly focused nature of the experimental manipulation.},

This letter presents the design of a variable damping force tunnel and explores the effect of the shape and strength of the damping field using ALEX III, a treadmill-based exoskeleton developed at Columbia University. The study consists of 32 healthy subjects who were trained for 40 min in the device. The subjects were trained to follow a footpath with a 50\% increase in step height, so the foot would have 1.5 times the ground clearance. Subjects were assigned to one of four groups: linear high, linear low, parabolic high, and parabolic low. Linear or parabolic denotes the shape of the damping field, and high or low denotes the rate of change (strength) of the field based on error. It is shown that the new controller is capable of inducing gait adaptations in healthy individuals while walking in the device. All groups showed adaptations in step height, while only the high strength groups showed changes in normalized error area, a measure of how closely the desired path was followed.},

  abstract = {Background: Currently, control of exoskeletons in rehabilitation focuses on imposing desired trajectories to promote relearning of motions. Furthermore, assistance is often provided by imposing these desired trajectories using impedance controllers. However, lower-limb exoskeletons are also a promising solution for mobility problems of individuals in daily life. To develop an assistive exoskeleton which allows the user to be autonomous, i.e. in control of his motions, remains a challenge. This paper presents a model-based control method to tackle this challenge. Methods: The model-based control method utilizes a dynamic model of the exoskeleton to compensate for its own dynamics. After this compensation of the exoskeleton dynamics, the exoskeleton can provide a desired assistance to the user. While dynamic models of exoskeletons used in the literature focus on gravity compensation only, the need for modelling and monitoring of the ground contact impedes their widespread use. The control strategy proposed here relies on modelling of the full exoskeleton dynamics and of the contacts with the environment. A modelling strategy and general control scheme are introduced. Results: Validation of the control method on 15 non-disabled adults performing sit-to-stand motions shows that muscle effort and joint torques are similar in the conditions with dynamically compensated exoskeleton and without exoskeleton. The condition with exoskeleton in which the compensating controller was not active showed a significant increase in human joint torques and muscle effort at the knee and hip. Motor saturation occurred during the assisted condition, which limited the assistance the exoskeleton could deliver. Conclusions: This work presents the modelling steps and controller design to compensate the exoskeleton dynamics. The validation seems to indicate that the presented model-based controller is able to compensate the exoskeleton.},

They are designed in different architectures to assist their users' movements. The research literature has been more prolific on lower-limb devices: a main reason is that they address a basic but fundamental motion task, walking. Leg exoskeletons are simpler to design, compared to upper-limb counterparts, but still have particular cognitive and physical requirements from the emerging human{\textendash}robot interaction systems. In the state of the art, different control strategies and approaches can be easily found: it is still a challenge to develop an assistive strategy which makes the exoskeleton supply efficient and natural assistance. So, this paper aims to provide a systematic overview of the assistive strategies utilized by active locomotion{\textendash}augmentation orthoses and exoskeletons. Based on the literature collected from Web of Science and Scopus, we have studied the main robotic devices with a focus on the way they are controlled to deliver assistance; the relevant validations are as well investigated, in particular experimentations with human in the loop. Finally current trends and major challenges in the development of an assistive strategy are concluded and discussed.},

We analyzed common approaches in exoskeleton design and the convergence, or lack thereof, with certain technologies. We focused on actuators, sensors, energy sources, materials, and control strategies. One of the largest hurdles to be overcome in exoskeleton research is the user interface and control. More intuitive and flexible user interfaces are needed to increase the success of robotic exoskeletons. In the last section, we discuss promising future solutions to the major hurdles in exoskeleton control. A number of emerging technologies could deliver substantial advantages to existing and future exoskeleton designs.

We have developed a method for identifying the exoskeleton assistance that minimizes human energy cost during walking. Optimized torque patterns from an exoskeleton worn on one ankle reduced metabolic energy consumption by 24.2 {$\pm$} 7.4\% compared to no torque. The approach was effective with exoskeletons worn on one or both ankles, during a variety of walking conditions, during running, and when optimizing muscle activity. Finding a good generic assistance pattern, customizing it to individual needs, and helping users learn to take advantage of the device all contributed to improved economy. Optimization methods with these features can substantially improve performance.},

  abstract = {随着人工智能技术的发展,机器智能得到不断的提高,随之而来的则是机器智能得以在各行各业应用发展。在此进程中,不可避免的会遇到机器自主性不足以解决本身该由人类解决或者人类必须参与决策的情况,考虑此种场景下人类智能和机器智能共同作用的决策问题则显得尤为重要和有意义。更具体地,序贯决策问题作为一类具有时序性和多阶段性的动态决策问题,其发展与当下人工智能时代下的工程应用、生产生活等领域息息相关。人的作用体现在序贯决策问题的两方面,一则,人本身属于序贯决策问题模型中的一部分,即该类问题是离不开人的如微创外科手术等;二则,人的相关信息不体现在序贯决策问题模型中,而是因人独特的认知能力使得其可以出现在问题的求解办法中,达到改善问题求解的目的如人对机器搜救系统的引导等,本文将上述两种场景统称为``人机序贯决策问题。针对人机序贯决策问题,由于人类智能和机器智能本质上的区别,数学表达上的巨大差异,使得人和机器共同作用于问题求解时,不可避免的因为协调原因造成决策质量不高甚至决策失误的现象。然而直接应用传统人机系统的控制算法不能有效处理这些问题,从而引起机器代理失效,人力浪费,甚至还会造成决策系统性能恶化甚至崩溃。因此,亟需设计有效的人机混合智能算法来解决这些问题。本文以人机序贯决策问题为研究对象,围绕人机混合智能控制中的决策权限划分、介入控制触发切换时机和共享控制混合人机决策动作程度三个问题展开研究,旨在提出有效的人机混合智能算法来改善提升人机序贯决策问题的求解。本文的研究工作主要包括以下几个方面:1.提出了基于强化学习方法的人机混合智能控制框架。通过将机器代理的决策和人类的决策以可信性和安全性为评价指标进行仲裁选择,以确定更优的待执行决策动作。同时考虑了基于模型的强化学习子系统和基于无模型的强化学习子系统,为适应广泛的序贯决策应用场景提供了更多可能。2.针对人机序贯决策中的介入控制问题,提出了自主性及自主性边界的概念,通过将自主性边界的求解形式化为与任务目标相关的常规优化问题进行讨论判定,优化介入控制的控制方案和算法,实现人机序贯决策中人介入机器场景和机器介入人场景下的决策性能提升。3.针对人机序贯决策中的共享控制问题,提出了基于自主性边界的混合参数优化设计方案,通过自适应调节混合参数大小直接影响最终待执行动作的生成。考虑了人机动作的融合程度,使得最优解在人的动作空间和机器的动作空间所共同张成的扩展空间中出现,为决策质量的提升提供了扩展空间。4.针对介入控制和共享控制中所估计的自主性边界值可能存在单值估计不准确的问题,提出了基于贝叶斯神经网络的不确定性估计办法,获得自主性边界的概率分布信息并用于决策动作生成,利用自主性边界的不确定性优化设计人机混合智能算法,既使得决策动作的优化存在更多选择,也更加符合人们对决策边界的模糊性思考。综上所述,本文面向人机序贯决策对混合智能算法所面临的问题进行了系统性的研究,创新性地提出了对应的解决方案,推动了人机序贯决策求解和混合智能算法的进一步发展。},
