  abstract = {A new method of lower-limb exoskeleton control aimed at improving the agility of leg-swing motion is presented. In the absence of control, an exoskeleton's mechanism usually hinders agility by adding mechanical impedance to the legs. The uncompensated inertia of the exoskeleton will reduce the natural frequency of leg swing, probably leading to lower step frequency during walking as well as increased metabolic energy consumption. The proposed controller emulates inertia compensation by adding a feedback loop consisting of low-pass filtered angular acceleration multiplied by a negative gain. This gain simulates negative inertia in the low-frequency range. The resulting controller combines two assistive effects: increasing the natural frequency of the lower limbs and performing net work per swing cycle. The controller was tested on a statically mounted exoskeleton that assists knee flexion and extension. Subjects performed movement sequences, first unassisted and then using the exoskeleton, in the context of a computer-based task resembling a race. In the exoskeleton's baseline state, the frequency of leg swing and the mean angular velocity were consistently reduced. The addition of inertia compensation enabled subjects to recover their normal frequency and increase their selected angular velocity. The work performed by the exoskeleton was evidenced by catch trials in the protocol.},

  abstract = {Smart powered wheelchairs can increase mobility and independence for people with disability by providing navigation support. This support can be supplied in the form of autonomous or semi-autonomous obstacle avoidance systems. However, for rehabilitation or learning purposes, it would be of great benefit for wheelchair users to have a better understanding of the surrounding environment while driving. Therefore, another way of providing navigation support is to communicate information through a dedicated and adapted feedback interface. We here propose a framework in which feedback is provided by sending forces through the wheelchair controller as the user steers the wheelchair. This solution is based on a low complex optimization framework able to perform smooth trajectory correction and to provide obstacle avoidance. The impact of the proposed haptic guidance solution on user driving performance was assessed during this pilot study for validation purposes through an experiment with 4 able-bodied participants. They were asked to drive a power wheelchair on an obstacle course with and without activation of the force feedback. Results of this pilot study showed that the number of collisions significantly decreased while force feedback was activated, thus validating the proposed framework.},

However, response variance between participants for fixed control strategies can be high, leading to the hypothesis that individualized controllers could further improve walking economy. Recent studies on human-in-the-loop (HIL) control optimization have elucidated several practical challenges, such as long experimental protocols and low signal-to-noise ratios. Here, we used Bayesian optimization{\textemdash}an algorithm well suited to optimizing noisy performance signals with very limited data{\textemdash}to identify the peak and offset timing of hip extension assistance that minimizes the energy expenditure of walking with a textile-based wearable device. Optimal peak and offset timing were found over an average of 21.4 {$\pm$} 1.0 min and reduced metabolic cost by 17.4 {$\pm$} 3.2\% compared with walking without the device (mean {$\pm$} SEM), which represents an improvement of more than 60\% on metabolic reduction compared with state-of-the-art devices that only assist hip extension. In addition, our results provide evidence for participant-specific metabolic distributions with respect to peak and offset timing and metabolic landscapes, lending support to the hypothesis that individualized control strategies can offer substantial benefits over fixed control strategies. These results also suggest that this method could have practical impact on improving the performance of wearable robotic devices.},

In this research, an electric wheelchair is controlled as an example. The user can continuously control the wheelchair to turn left/right through motion imagination (MI) by imagining left/right-hand movement and generate another 6 commands for the wheelchair control by focusing on the SSVEP stimulation panel. Ten subjects participated in a MI training session and eight of them completed a mobile obstacle-avoidance experiment in a complex environment requesting high control accuracy for successful manipulation. Comparing with the single-modal BCI-controlled wheelchair system, the results demonstrate that the proposed multi-modal method is effective by providing more satisfactory control accuracy, and show the potential of BCI-controlled systems to be applied in complex daily tasks.},

The Reflectance Field Map combines the theory developed for Light Field Mapping, common in computer graphics, with occupancy grid mapping. Like early methods for sonar-based robot mapping, we show how the addition of angular viewpoint information to a standard 2D grid map enables robust mapping in the presence of specular reflections. However unlike previous approaches, our method works in dynamic environments. Additionally, unlike recent approaches for lidar-based mapping of specular surfaces, our approach is sensor-agnostic and has no reliance on either intensity or multi-return measurements. We demonstrate the ability of the Reflectance Field Map to accurately map a campus environment containing numerous pedestrians and significant plate glass, both straight and curved. The algorithm runs in real-time (75+Hz) on a single core of a standard desktop processor.

  abstract = {Many assistive robotic devices have been developed to augment or assist human locomotion. Despite advancements in design and control algorithms, this task remains challenging. Human walking strategies are unique and complex, and assistance strategies based on the dynamics of unassisted locomotion typically offer only modest reductions to the metabolic cost of walking. Recently, human-in-the-loop (HIL) methodologies have been used to identify subject-specific assistive strategies, which offer significant improvements to energy savings. However, current implementations suffer from long measurement times, necessitating the use of low-dimensional control parameterizations, and possibly requiring multiday collection protocols to avoid subject fatigue. We present a HIL methodology, which optimizes the assistive torques provided by a powered hip exoskeleton. Using musculoskeletal modeling, we are able to evaluate simulated metabolic rate online. We applied our methodology to identify assistive torque profiles for seven subjects walking on a treadmill, and found greater reductions to metabolic cost when compared to generic or off-the-shelf controllers. In a secondary investigation, we directly compare simulated and measured metabolic rate for three subjects experiencing a range of assistance levels. The time investment required to identify assistance strategies via our protocol is significantly lower when compared to existing protocols relying on calorimetry. In the future, frameworks such as these could be used to enable shorter HIL protocols or exploit more complex control parameterizations for greater energy savings.},

Exoskeletal robotic assistive devices can provide a user with continuous assistance but impose movement restrictions. There are currently devices that allow unrestricted movement but provide assistance only intermittently at specific points of the gait cycle. Our design, a cable-driven active leg exoskeleton (C-ALEX), allows the user both unrestricted movement and continuous force assistance throughout the gait cycle to assist the user in new walking patterns. In this study, we assessed the ability of C-ALEX to induce a change in the walking patterns of ten post-stroke participants using a single-session training protocol. The ability of C-ALEX to accurately provide forces and torques in the desired directions was also evaluated to compare its design performance to traditional rigid-link designs. Participants were able to reach 91\% {$\pm$} 12\% of their target step length and 89\% {$\pm$} 13 \% of their target step height. The achieved step parameters differed significantly from participant baselines (p {$<$} 0.05). To quantify the performance, the forces in each cable's out of the plane movements were evaluated relative to the in-plane desired cable tension magnitudes. This corresponded to an error of under 2Nm in the desired controlled joint torques. This error magnitude is low compared to the system command torques and typical adult biological torques during walking (2-4\%).},

In walking assistance of hemiplegia patients, the exoskeleton should have the ability to control the affected leg to follow the unaffected leg's motion naturally. One critical issue of walking assistance for hemiplegia patients is how to adapt the controller of both lower limbs with different patients. This paper presents a novel learning-based walking assistance control strategy for lower exoskeleton with hemiplegia patients. In the proposed control strategy, we modeled the control system of lower exoskeleton with hemiplegia patient as a Leader-Follower Multi-Agent System (LF-MAS). In order to adapt different patients with different conditions, reinforcement learning framework is utilized to adapt controllers online. In reinforcement learning framework with LF-MAS, we employed a Policy Iteration Adaptive Dynamic Programming (PI-ADP) algorithm, which aims to achieve better tracking control performance for lower exoskeleton with hemiplegia patient. We demonstrate the efficiency of proposed learning-based walking assistance control strategy in an exoskeleton system with healthy subjects who simulate hemiplegia patients. Experimental results indicate that the proposed control strategy can adapt different pilots with good tracking performance.},

The human aspect of SW interaction receives considerable attention, specifically in terms of privacy, physiological factors, and the refinement of control mechanisms. The paper acknowledges the commercial challenges faced, like the limitations of indoor usage and the necessity for user training. For future applications, the research explores the potential of autonomous systems adept at adapting to changing environments and user needs. This exploration includes reinforcement learning and various control methods, such as eye and voice control, to improve adaptability and interaction. The potential integration with smart home technologies, including advanced features such as robotic arms, is also considered, aiming to further enhance user accessibility and independence. Ultimately, this study seeks to provide a thorough overview of SW systems, presenting extensive research to detail their historical evolution, current state, and future prospects.},

  abstract = {A smart wheelchair (SW) is a power wheelchair (PW) to which computers, sensors, and assistive technology are attached. In the past decade, there has been little effort to provide a systematic review of SW research. This paper aims to provide a complete state-of-the-art overview of SW research trends. We expect that the information gathered in this study will enhance awareness of the status of contemporary PW as well as SW technology, and increase the functional mobility of people who use PWs. We systematically present the international SW research effort, starting with an introduction to power wheelchairs and the communities they serve. Then we discuss in detail the SW and associated technological innovations with an emphasis on the most researched areas, generating the most interest for future research and development. We conclude with our vision for the future of SW research and how to best serve people with all types of disabilities.},

The WRT speed was lower in the resist condition than in the control condition which reinforces hypotheses from previous simulations, descriptive and experimental studies. There was no increase in WRT speed in the assist condition which is in contrast to another study where the plantarflexor push off was assisted indirectly by a horizontal traction at waist level. The lack of effect from the assist condition in the present study is possibly due to the narrowly focused nature of the experimental manipulation.},

  abstract = {Brain-computer interface (BCI) based systems can be used to control external devices by translating a certain set of patterns in the brain signals into actions. An example of this is a BCI controlled wheelchair, with the actions being navigating the wheelchair. In this paper, a Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) based BCI system that controls the operations (forward, reverse, left, and right) of an electrical wheelchair is presented. This system utilizes four LEDs with different flickering frequencies as a visual stimulation source. By providing concentration to these visual stimulation sources, the SSVEP signals are entrained in the occipital and posterior region of the brain. The acquired SSVEP signals are classified into four different frequency ranges representing each of the directions using suitable signal processing algorithms. Based on this classification, a specific control signal is derived to navigate the wheelchair in the desired direction. This system can assist individuals who suffer from neuromuscular degenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Locked-in Syndrome (LIS), etc., with the navigation of an electric wheelchair using their brain waves. Five peripheral safety sensors are mounted on the wheelchair to avoid the risk of collisions while operating the wheelchair. Once an obstacle is detected by these sensors, a control signal is sent from the Arduino microcontroller to stop the wheelchair. Three experiments were conducted on four subjects to measure the accuracy and reliability of the system. Our results show that the presented system allows the user to navigate to their intended direction with an average accuracy of 79.4\%. Also, the safety mechanism incorporated results in an accuracy of 100\% obstacle avoidance. Our results show that on average a user can navigate 50 feet set path in approximately five minutes.},

The objective of this study is to develop a BCI system that requires a low number of inputs from a subject to operate. We propose an autonomous wheelchair that uses steadystate visual evoked potential based brain computer interfaces to achieve the objective. A dual mode system was implemented in this study to allow the autonomous wheelchair to work in both unknown and known environments. Robot operating system is used as the middleware in this study for the development of the algorithm to operate the wheelchair. The mental task for the subject using this wheelchair is reduced by relegating the responsibility of navigation control from the subject to the navigation software.},

  abstract = {Lower limb exoskeleton (LLE) has received considerable interests in strength augmentation, rehabilitation and walking assistance scenarios. For walking assistance, the LLE is expected to have the capability of controlling the affected leg to track the unaffected leg's motion naturally. An important issue in this scenario is that the exoskeleton system needs to deal with unpredictable disturbance from the patient, which requires the controller of exoskeleton system to have the ability to adapt to different wearers. This paper proposes a novel Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning (DDRL) control strategy to adapt different hemiplegic patients with unpredictable disturbances. In the proposed DDRL strategy, the interaction between two lower limbs of LLE and the legs of hemiplegic patient are modeled in the context of leader-follower framework. The walking assistance control problem is transformed into a optimal control problem. Then, a policy iteration (PI) algorithm is introduced to learn optimal controller. To achieve online adaptation control for different patients, based on PI algorithm, an Actor-Critic Neural Network (ACNN) technology of the reinforcement learning (RL) is employed in the proposed DDRL. We conduct experiments both on a simulation environment and a real LLE system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy has strong robustness against disturbances and adaptability to different pilots.},

Using a slow but reliable P300 based BCI, the user selects a destination amongst a list of predefined locations. While the wheelchair moves on virtual guiding paths ensuring smooth, safe, and predictable trajectories, the user can stop the wheelchair by using a faster BCI. Experiments with nondisabled subjects demonstrated the efficiency of this strategy. Brain control was not affected when the wheelchair was in motion, and the BCW enabled the users to move to various locations in less time and with significantly less control effort than other control strategies proposed in the literature.},

  abstract = {Throughout the last decade, many assistive robots for people with disabilities have been developed; however, researchers have not fully utilized these robotic technologies to entirely create independent living conditions for people with disabilities, particularly in relation to activities of daily living (ADLs). An assistive system can help satisfy the demands of regular ADLs for people with disabilities. With an increasing shortage of caregivers and a growing number of individuals with impairments and the elderly, assistive robots can help meet future healthcare demands. One of the critical aspects of designing these assistive devices is to improve functional independence while providing an excellent human{\textendash}machine interface. People with limited upper limb function due to stroke, spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and other conditions find the controls of assistive devices such as power wheelchairs difficult to use. Thus, the objective of this research was to design a multimodal control method for robotic self-assistance that could assist individuals with disabilities in performing self-care tasks on a daily basis. In this research, a control framework for two interchangeable operating modes with a finger joystick and a chin joystick is developed where joysticks seamlessly control a wheelchair and a wheelchair-mounted robotic arm. Custom circuitry was developed to complete the control architecture. A user study was conducted to test the robotic system. Ten healthy individuals agreed to perform three tasks using both (chin and finger) joysticks for a total of six tasks with 10 repetitions each. The control method has been tested rigorously, maneuvering the robot at different velocities and under varying payload (1{\textendash}3.5 lb) conditions. The absolute position accuracy was experimentally found to be approximately 5 mm. The round-trip delay we observed between the commands while controlling the xArm was 4 ms. Tests performed showed that the proposed control system allowed individuals to perform some ADLs such as picking up and placing items with a completion time of less than 1 min for each task and 100\% success.},

In this work we evaluate the assistive power and the generalisation capability of LAD using our custom teleoperation and learning system for smart wheelchairs, while seeking to improve it by experimenting with different combinations of dimensionality reduction techniques and machine learning models. Using Autoencoders to reduce the dimension of laserscan data and a Gaussian Process as the learning model, we achieved a 23\% improvement in prediction performance against the combination used by the latest work on the field. Using this model to assist a driver exposed to a simulated disability, we observed a 9.8\% reduction in track completion times when compared to driving without assistance.},

This letter presents the design of a variable damping force tunnel and explores the effect of the shape and strength of the damping field using ALEX III, a treadmill-based exoskeleton developed at Columbia University. The study consists of 32 healthy subjects who were trained for 40 min in the device. The subjects were trained to follow a footpath with a 50\% increase in step height, so the foot would have 1.5 times the ground clearance. Subjects were assigned to one of four groups: linear high, linear low, parabolic high, and parabolic low. Linear or parabolic denotes the shape of the damping field, and high or low denotes the rate of change (strength) of the field based on error. It is shown that the new controller is capable of inducing gait adaptations in healthy individuals while walking in the device. All groups showed adaptations in step height, while only the high strength groups showed changes in normalized error area, a measure of how closely the desired path was followed.},

The majority of controllers that do not rely on coordinated arm and hand movements provide users a limited vocabulary of commands and often do not take advantage of the user's residual motion. We developed a body-machine interface (BMI) that leverages the flexibility and customizability of redundant control by using high dimensional changes in shoulder kinematics to generate proportional control commands for a power wheelchair. In this study, three individuals with cervical spinal cord injuries were able to control a power wheelchair safely and accurately using only small shoulder movements. With the BMI, participants were able to achieve their desired trajectories and, after five sessions driving, were able to achieve smoothness that was similar to the smoothness with their current joystick. All participants were twice as slow using the BMI however improved with practice. Importantly, users were able to generalize training controlling a computer to driving a power wheelchair, and employed similar strategies when controlling both devices. Overall, this work suggests that the BMI can be an effective wheelchair control interface for individuals with high-level spinal cord injuries who have limited arm and hand control.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Shared autonomy has played a major role in assistive mobile robotics as it has the potential to effectively balance user satisfaction and smooth functioning of systems by adapting itself to each user's needs and preferences. Many shared control paradigms have been developed over the years. However, despite these advancements, shared control paradigms have not been widely adopted as there are several integral aspects that have not fully matured. The purpose of this paper is to discuss and review various aspects of shared control and the technologies leading up to the current advancements in shared control for assistive mobile robots. Methods: A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted following a dichotomy of studies from the pre-2000 and the post-2000 periods to focus on both the early developments and the current state of the art in this domain. Results: A systematic review of 135 research papers and 7 review papers selected from the literature was conducted. To facilitate the organization of the reviewed work, a 6-level ladder categorization was developed based on the extent of autonomy shared between the human and the robot in the use of assistive mobile robots. This taxonomy highlights the chronological improvements in this domain. Conclusion: It was found that most prior studies have focussed on basic functionalities, thus paving the way for research to now focus on the higher levels of the ladder taxonomy. It was concluded that further research in the domain must focus on ensuring safety in mobility and adaptability to varying environments.},

  abstract = {Background: Currently, control of exoskeletons in rehabilitation focuses on imposing desired trajectories to promote relearning of motions. Furthermore, assistance is often provided by imposing these desired trajectories using impedance controllers. However, lower-limb exoskeletons are also a promising solution for mobility problems of individuals in daily life. To develop an assistive exoskeleton which allows the user to be autonomous, i.e. in control of his motions, remains a challenge. This paper presents a model-based control method to tackle this challenge. Methods: The model-based control method utilizes a dynamic model of the exoskeleton to compensate for its own dynamics. After this compensation of the exoskeleton dynamics, the exoskeleton can provide a desired assistance to the user. While dynamic models of exoskeletons used in the literature focus on gravity compensation only, the need for modelling and monitoring of the ground contact impedes their widespread use. The control strategy proposed here relies on modelling of the full exoskeleton dynamics and of the contacts with the environment. A modelling strategy and general control scheme are introduced. Results: Validation of the control method on 15 non-disabled adults performing sit-to-stand motions shows that muscle effort and joint torques are similar in the conditions with dynamically compensated exoskeleton and without exoskeleton. The condition with exoskeleton in which the compensating controller was not active showed a significant increase in human joint torques and muscle effort at the knee and hip. Motor saturation occurred during the assisted condition, which limited the assistance the exoskeleton could deliver. Conclusions: This work presents the modelling steps and controller design to compensate the exoskeleton dynamics. The validation seems to indicate that the presented model-based controller is able to compensate the exoskeleton.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a framework that enables robots to efficiently learn human-centric models of their environment from natural language descriptions. Typical semantic mapping approaches are limited to augmenting metric maps with higherlevel properties of the robot's surroundings (e.g. place type, object locations) that can be inferred from the robot's sensor data, but do not use this information to improve the metric map. The novelty of our algorithm lies in fusing high-level knowledge that people can uniquely provide through speech with metric information from the robot's low-level sensor streams. Our method jointly estimates a hybrid metric, topological, and semantic representation of the environment. This semantic graph provides a common framework in which we integrate information that the user communicates (e.g. labels and spatial relations) with metric observations from low-level sensors. Our algorithm efficiently maintains a factored distribution over semantic graphs based upon the stream of natural language and low-level sensor information. We detail the means by which the framework incorporates knowledge conveyed by the user's descriptions, including the ability to reason over expressions that reference yet unknown regions in the environment. We evaluate the algorithm's ability to learn human-centric maps of several different environments and analyze the knowledge inferred from language and the utility of the learned maps. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of information from free-form descriptions increases the metric, topological, and semantic accuracy of the recovered environment model.},

They are designed in different architectures to assist their users' movements. The research literature has been more prolific on lower-limb devices: a main reason is that they address a basic but fundamental motion task, walking. Leg exoskeletons are simpler to design, compared to upper-limb counterparts, but still have particular cognitive and physical requirements from the emerging human{\textendash}robot interaction systems. In the state of the art, different control strategies and approaches can be easily found: it is still a challenge to develop an assistive strategy which makes the exoskeleton supply efficient and natural assistance. So, this paper aims to provide a systematic overview of the assistive strategies utilized by active locomotion{\textendash}augmentation orthoses and exoskeletons. Based on the literature collected from Web of Science and Scopus, we have studied the main robotic devices with a focus on the way they are controlled to deliver assistance; the relevant validations are as well investigated, in particular experimentations with human in the loop. Finally current trends and major challenges in the development of an assistive strategy are concluded and discussed.},

We analyzed common approaches in exoskeleton design and the convergence, or lack thereof, with certain technologies. We focused on actuators, sensors, energy sources, materials, and control strategies. One of the largest hurdles to be overcome in exoskeleton research is the user interface and control. More intuitive and flexible user interfaces are needed to increase the success of robotic exoskeletons. In the last section, we discuss promising future solutions to the major hurdles in exoskeleton control. A number of emerging technologies could deliver substantial advantages to existing and future exoskeleton designs.

We have developed a method for identifying the exoskeleton assistance that minimizes human energy cost during walking. Optimized torque patterns from an exoskeleton worn on one ankle reduced metabolic energy consumption by 24.2 {$\pm$} 7.4\% compared to no torque. The approach was effective with exoskeletons worn on one or both ankles, during a variety of walking conditions, during running, and when optimizing muscle activity. Finding a good generic assistance pattern, customizing it to individual needs, and helping users learn to take advantage of the device all contributed to improved economy. Optimization methods with these features can substantially improve performance.},

  abstract = {Gait rehabilitation is essential for chronic stroke patients to regain independent walking ability and quality of life, of which symmetry is regarded as a gold standard of gait quality. In this letter, a cable-driven lower limb exoskeleton powered by series elastic actuators (SEAs) has been developed, and a generalized gait-phase-based assistive strategy has been presented to enhance the gait symmetry of chronic stroke patients in the future. This strategy features a parameterized assistive force generation method that allows individuals customization to achieve more synchronized assistance with their walking gait patterns. A compliant human-robot interaction is guaranteed by SEA, and the exoskeleton exhibits low passive impedance and good transparency. The proposed assistive strategy was evaluated with five able-bodied subjects walking with the assistance from exoskeleton while adding artificial impairments to mimic a pathological gait with deficits (i.e., reduced knee flexion and foot-drop). Experimental results proved its efficacy in enhancing temporal walking gait symmetry to the levels comparable to participants' normal gait.},
