  abstract = {Impairments resulting from stroke lead to persistent difficulties with walking. Subsequently, an improved walking ability is one of the highest priorities for people living with stroke. The degree to which gait can be restored after a stroke is related to both the initial impairment in walking ability and the severity of paresis of the lower extremities. However, there are some patients with severe motor paralysis and a markedly disrupted corticospinal tract who regain their gait function. Recently, several case reports have described the recovery of gait function in stroke patients with severe hemiplegia by providing alternate gait training. Multiple studies have demonstrated that gait training can induce ``locomotor-like'' coordinated muscle activity of paralyzed lower limbs in people with spinal cord injury. In the present review, we discuss the neural mechanisms of gait, and then we review case reports on the restoration of gait function in stroke patients with severe hemiplegia.},

  abstract = {Understanding the potential causes of both reduced gait speed and compensatory frontal plane kinematics during walking in individuals post-stroke may be useful in developing effective rehabilitation strategies. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to select the combination of paretic limb impairments (frontal and sagittal plane hip strength, sagittal plane knee and ankle strength, and multi-joint knee/hip torque coupling) which best estimate gait speed and compensatory pelvic obliquity velocities at toeoff. Compensatory behaviors were defined as deviations from control subjects' values. The gait speed model (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 18; p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.003) revealed that greater hip abduction strength and multi-joint coupling of sagittal plane knee and frontal plane hip torques were associated with decreased velocity; however, gait speed was positively associated with paretic hip extension strength. Multi-joint coupling was the most influential predictor of gait speed. The second model (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 15; po0.001) revealed that multi-joint coupling was associated with increased compensatory pelvic movement at toeoff; while hip extension and flexion and knee flexion strength were associated with reduced frontal plane pelvic compensations. In this case, hip extension strength had the greatest influence on pelvic behavior. The analyses revealed that different yet overlapping sets of single joint strength and multi-joint coupling measures were associated with gait speed and compensatory pelvic behavior during walking post-stroke. These findings provide insight regarding the potential impact of targeted rehabilitation paradigms on improving speed and compensatory kinematics following stroke. \& 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, response variance between participants for fixed control strategies can be high, leading to the hypothesis that individualized controllers could further improve walking economy. Recent studies on human-in-the-loop (HIL) control optimization have elucidated several practical challenges, such as long experimental protocols and low signal-to-noise ratios. Here, we used Bayesian optimization{\textemdash}an algorithm well suited to optimizing noisy performance signals with very limited data{\textemdash}to identify the peak and offset timing of hip extension assistance that minimizes the energy expenditure of walking with a textile-based wearable device. Optimal peak and offset timing were found over an average of 21.4 {$\pm$} 1.0 min and reduced metabolic cost by 17.4 {$\pm$} 3.2\% compared with walking without the device (mean {$\pm$} SEM), which represents an improvement of more than 60\% on metabolic reduction compared with state-of-the-art devices that only assist hip extension. In addition, our results provide evidence for participant-specific metabolic distributions with respect to peak and offset timing and metabolic landscapes, lending support to the hypothesis that individualized control strategies can offer substantial benefits over fixed control strategies. These results also suggest that this method could have practical impact on improving the performance of wearable robotic devices.},

Existing methods typically treat the human and control interface as a black box and assume the measured user input is noise-free, and use this signal to infer task-level human intent. We recognize that the signal measured through the interface is masked by the physical limitations of the user and the interface they are required to use. With this key insight, we model the human's physical interaction with a control interface during robot teleoperation, and distinguish between interface-level intended and measured physical actions explicitly. By reasoning over the unobserved intentions using model-based inference techniques, our assistive system provides customized modifications on a user's issued commands. We validate our algorithm both in simulation and with a 10-person human subject study in which we evaluate the performance of the proposed assistance paradigms. Our results show that the assistance paradigms helped to significantly reduce task completion time, number of mode switches, cognitive workload, and user frustration, and improve overall user satisfaction.},

This paper proposes the use of wireless gyroscopes as a new instrument to determine gait asymmetry. It also introduces two novel approaches: normalized cross-correlations (Ccnorm) and Normalized Symmetry Index (SInorm). Ccnorm evaluates the waveform patterns generated by the lower limb in each gait cycle. SInorm provides indications on the timing and magnitude of the bilateral differences between the limbs while addressing the drawbacks of the conventional methods. One-way ANOVA test reveals that Ccnorm can be considered as single value indicator that determines the gait asymmetry (po0.01). The experiment results showed that SInorm in asymmetrical gait were different from normal gait. SInorm in asymmetrical gait were found to be approximately 20\% greater than SInorm in normal gait during pre-swing and initial swing.},

However, current methods for shared autonomy are not designed to address the wide range of necessary corrections (e.g., positions, forces, execution rate, etc.) that the user may need to provide to address task variability. In this letter, we present corrective shared autonomy, where users provide corrections to key robot state variables on top of an otherwise autonomous task model. We provide an instantiation of this shared autonomy paradigm and demonstrate its viability and benefits such as low user effort and physical demand via a system-level user study on three tasks involving variability situated in aircraft manufacturing.},

In walking assistance of hemiplegia patients, the exoskeleton should have the ability to control the affected leg to follow the unaffected leg's motion naturally. One critical issue of walking assistance for hemiplegia patients is how to adapt the controller of both lower limbs with different patients. This paper presents a novel learning-based walking assistance control strategy for lower exoskeleton with hemiplegia patients. In the proposed control strategy, we modeled the control system of lower exoskeleton with hemiplegia patient as a Leader-Follower Multi-Agent System (LF-MAS). In order to adapt different patients with different conditions, reinforcement learning framework is utilized to adapt controllers online. In reinforcement learning framework with LF-MAS, we employed a Policy Iteration Adaptive Dynamic Programming (PI-ADP) algorithm, which aims to achieve better tracking control performance for lower exoskeleton with hemiplegia patient. We demonstrate the efficiency of proposed learning-based walking assistance control strategy in an exoskeleton system with healthy subjects who simulate hemiplegia patients. Experimental results indicate that the proposed control strategy can adapt different pilots with good tracking performance.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear dynamical systems have been used in many disciplines to model complex behaviors, including biological motor control, robotics, perception, economics, traffic prediction, and neuroscience. While often the unexpected emergent behavior of nonlinear systems is the focus of investigations, it is of equal importance to create goal-directed behavior (e.g., stable locomotion from a system of coupled oscillators under perceptual guidance). Modeling goal-directed behavior with nonlinear systems is, however, rather difficult due to the parameter sensitivity of these systems, their complex phase transitions in response to subtle parameter changes, and the difficulty of analyzing and predicting their long-term behavior; intuition and time-consuming parameter tuning play a major role. This letter presents and reviews dynamical movement primitives, a line of research for modeling attractor behaviors of autonomous nonlinear dynamical systems with the help of statistical learning techniques. The essence of our approach is to start with a simple dynamical system, such as a set of linear differential equations, and transform those into a weakly nonlinear system with prescribed attractor dynamics by means of a learnable autonomous forcing term. Both point attractors and limit cycle attractors of almost arbitrary complexity can be generated. We explain the design principle of our approach and evaluate its properties in several example applications in motor control and robotics.},

METHODS: We evaluated 66 adult patients (33 men and 33 women), aged 45.4 {$\pm$} 8.5 years (mean {$\pm$} SD), with a diagnosis of ischemic cerebrovascular accident either right or left hemiparesis and brachial prevalence. All the participants underwent 3dimensional gait evaluation with a Vicon 370, and the values of the angular kinematics of the knee joint were selected for analysis. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences (by the Kruskal-Wallis test) between the subjects regarding the following variables: angular knee position at initial contact and time of peak knee flexion in the stance. The clinically relevant characteristics found were: an increase in knee joint flexion during the initial contact and a movement amplitude below that anticipated in this phase of the walking cycle. These should be taken into account when choosing the best treatment, because they are the ones which exhibit the most important alteration in the load-response mechanism in all patients. CONCLUSION: There is still no consensus among the different specialists regarding the variations in kinematics during the hemiparetic gait. One of the most frequently discussed joints is the knee{\textemdash}the way the main changes take place during the gait cycle and whether the gait velocity changes the patterns of joint mobility.},

For walking assistance, the LLE is expected to have the capability of controlling the affected leg to track the unaffected leg's motion naturally. An important issue in this scenario is that the exoskeleton system needs to deal with unpredictable disturbance from the patient, which requires the controller of exoskeleton system to have the ability to adapt to different wearers. This paper proposes a novel Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning (DDRL) control strategy to adapt different hemiplegic patients with unpredictable disturbances. In the proposed DDRL strategy, the interaction between two lower limbs of LLE and the legs of hemiplegic patient are modeled in the context of leader-follower framework. The walking assistance control problem is transformed into a optimal control problem. Then, a policy iteration (PI) algorithm is introduced to learn optimal controller. To achieve online adaptation control for different patients, based on PI algorithm, an Actor-Critic Neural Network (ACNN) technology of the reinforcement learning (RL) is employed in the proposed DDRL. We conduct experiments both on a simulation environment and a real LLE system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy has strong robustness against disturbances and adaptability to different pilots.},

They are interesting because of their synchronization properties when coupled to other dynamical systems. In this paper, we propose a learning rule for oscillators which adapts their frequency to the frequency of any periodic or pseudo-periodic input signal. Learning is done in a dynamic way: it is part of the dynamical system and not an offline process. An interesting property of our model is that it is easily generalizable to a large class of oscillators, from phase oscillators to relaxation oscillators and strange attractors with a generic learning rule. One major feature of our learning rule is that the oscillators constructed can adapt their frequency without any signal processing or the need to specify a time window or similar free parameters. All the processing is embedded in the dynamics of the adaptive oscillator. The convergence of the learning is proved for the Hopf oscillator, then numerical experiments are carried out to explore the learning capabilities of the system. Finally, we generalize the learning rule to non-harmonic oscillators like relaxation oscillators and strange attractors.},

  abstract = {This review investigates two recent developments in artificial intelligence and neural computation: learning from imitation and the development of humanoid robots. It will be postulated that the study of imitation learning offers a promising route to gain new insights into mechanisms of perceptual motor control that could ultimately lead to the creation of autonomous humanoid robots. Imitation learning focuses on three important issues: efficient motor learning, the connection between action and perception, and modular motor control in form of movement primitives. It will be reviewed how research on representations of, and functional connections between action and perception have contributed to our understanding of motor acts of other beings. The recent discovery that some areas in the primate brain are active during both movement perception and execution has provided a hypothetical neural basis of imitation. Computational approaches to imitation learning will also be described, initially from the perspective of traditional AI and robotics, but also from the perspective of neural network models and statistical learning research. Parallels and differences between biological and computational approaches to imitation will be highlighted and an overview of current projects that actually employ imitation learning for humanoid robots will be given.},

In recent years, the development of inference and learning techniques has widened the spectrum of applications of shared control (SC) approaches, leading to robotic systems that are capable of seamless adaptation of their autonomy level. In this perspective, shared autonomy (SA) can be defined as the design paradigm that enables this adapting behavior of the robotic system. This letter collects the latest results achieved by the research community in the field of SC and SA with special emphasis on physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). Architectures and methods developed for SC and SA are discussed throughout the letter, highlighting the key aspects of each methodology. A discussion about open issues concludes this letter.},

  abstract = {Many of those who survive a stroke develop a gait disability known as stiff-knee gait (SKG). Characterized by reduced knee flexion angle during swing, people with SKG walk with poor energy efficiency and asymmetry due to the compensatory mechanisms required to clear the foot. Previous modeling studies have shown that knee flexion activity directly before the foot leaves the ground, and this should result in improved knee flexion angle during swing. The goal of this research is to physically test this hypothesis using robotic intervention. We developed a device that is capable of assisting knee flexion torque before swing but feels imperceptible (transparent) for the rest of the gait cycle. This device uses sheathed Bowden cable to control the deflection of a compliant torsional spring in a configuration known as a series elastic remote knee actuator (SERKA). In this investigation, we describe the design and evaluation of SERKA, which includes a pilot experiment on stroke subjects. SERKA could supply a substantial torque (12 N middot m) in less than 20 ms, with a maximum torque of 41 N middot m. The device resisted knee flexion imperceptibly when desired, at less than 1 N middot m rms torque during normal gait. With the remote location of the actuator, the user experiences a mass of only 1.2 kg on the knee. We found that the device was capable of increasing both peak knee flexion angle and velocity during gait in stroke subjects. Thus, the SERKA is a valid experimental device that selectively alters knee kinetics and kinematics in gait after stroke.},

  abstract = {Motion capture system has been widely used in virtual reality and rehabilitation area. This study proposed a data-driven method using low-dimensional input of inertial motion capture system to reconstruct human lower-limb motions. The long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network was used and an ensemble LSTM architecture was involved to improve reconstruction performance. Besides, the selection of optimal sensor configuration scheme and time-step parameters of LSTM network was discussed in detail. The reconstruction experiment shows that the method could get the lowest reconstruction joint angle root mean square (RMS) errors of 4.031{$\smwhtcircle$} on separated motion dataset, and 5.105{$\smwhtcircle$} on completely new dataset of synthetic motions using ensemble LSTM model with 18 base learner and three sensors units. The computational consumption test shows that the single and ensemble LSTM model spend 0.15ms and 0.91ms respectively to predict next frame. These findings demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and efficient for motions reconstruction of lower limbs.},

  abstract = {The origin of variability in goal-directed movements is not well understood. Variability can originate from several neural processes such as target localization, movement planning, and movement execution. Here we examine variability resulting from noise in movement execution. In several experiments, subjects moved their unseen hand to visual targets, under conditions which were designed to minimize the variability expected from localization and planning processes. We tested short movements in 32 directions in a center-out reaching task. The variability in the movement endpoints and in the initial movement direction varied systematically with the movement direction, with some directions having up to twice the variability of others. In a second experiment we tested four movements in the same direction but with different extents. Here, the longer movements were systematically curved, and the endpoint ellipses were not aligned with the straight line between starting and end position, but they were roughly aligned with the last part of the trajectory. We show that the variability observed in these experiments cannot be explained by planning noise but is well explained by noise in movement execution. A combination of both signal-dependent and signal-independent noise in the amplitude of the motor commands and temporal noise in their duration can explain the observed variability. Our results suggest that, in general, execution noise accounts for at least a large proportion of movement variability.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose{\textemdash}The aim of this study was to assess the role of knee and ankle extensor overactivity in the hemiplegic gait observed in stroke victims and to propose a clinical guide for selecting patients before treatment of a supposed disabling spasticity. Methods{\textemdash}A standardized physical examination procedure was performed in 135 consecutive stroke patients. All patients were able to walk without human assistance. The period after stroke ranged from 3 to 24 months (mean, 11.5Ϯ7.25 months). Spasticity was evaluated with the stroke victim in sitting position and during walking. Overactivity of the quadriceps was considered disabling when inducing inability to flex the knee during the swing phase despite adequate control of knee flexion in sitting and standing positions; overactivity of the triceps surae was considered to be disabling when heel strike was not possible despite good control of the ankle flexion in sitting position; triceps retraction was also considered. Results{\textemdash}Disabling overactivity was observed in 56 (41.5\%) patients: 11 times for the quadriceps femoris, 21 times for the triceps surae, and 21 times for both muscles. It was considered to be the main disorder impairing gait among only 16 (12\%) patients: 9 for the quadriceps alone, 3 for the triceps alone, and 4 for both. Sitting spasticity of the lower limb was not predictive of disabling overactivity during walking. Conclusions{\textemdash}Extensor muscle overactivity is one of the components of gait disorders in stroke patients. The difficulty in assessing spasticity and its real causal effect in gait disturbances are discussed. A clinical guide is proposed. (Stroke. 1999;30:580-585.)},

ALEX III is the first treadmill-based rehabilitation robot featuring 12 actively controlled degrees of freedom (DOF): 4 at the pelvis and 4 at each leg. As a first application of the device, we present an adaptive controller aimed to improve gait symmetry in hemiparetic subjects. The controller continuously modulates the assistive force applied to the impaired leg, based on the outputs of kernel-based non-linear filters, which learn the movements of the healthy leg. To test the effectiveness of the controller, we induced asymmetry in the gait of three young healthy subjects adding ankle weights (2.3kg). Results on kinematic data showed that gait symmetry was recovered when the controller was active.},

In this letter, a cable-driven lower limb exoskeleton powered by series elastic actuators (SEAs) has been developed, and a generalized gait-phase-based assistive strategy has been presented to enhance the gait symmetry of chronic stroke patients in the future. This strategy features a parameterized assistive force generation method that allows individuals customization to achieve more synchronized assistance with their walking gait patterns. A compliant human-robot interaction is guaranteed by SEA, and the exoskeleton exhibits low passive impedance and good transparency. The proposed assistive strategy was evaluated with five able-bodied subjects walking with the assistance from exoskeleton while adding artificial impairments to mimic a pathological gait with deficits (i.e., reduced knee flexion and foot-drop). Experimental results proved its efficacy in enhancing temporal walking gait symmetry to the levels comparable to participants' normal gait.},
